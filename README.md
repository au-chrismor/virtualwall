# virtualwall
Really simple "virtual wall" for your iRobot Roomba

Coded for an Arduino Nano, but would work with any similar device.  This project requires the IRemote library and should be compatible with most "classic" Arduino boards.  I used the Arduino Nano because of it's small size.

In addition you need an infrared LED (Jaycar, Altronics, Digi-Key, etc) and a 220R 1/4W resistor
