# virtualwall
Really simple "virtual wall" for your iRobot Roomba

Coded for an Arduino Nano, but would work with any similar device

In addition you need an infrared LED (Jaycar, Altronics, Digi-Key, etc) and a 220R 1/4W resistor

Pin 3 ------>|------\/\/\/----0V
            LED     Resistor
            
Enjoy
